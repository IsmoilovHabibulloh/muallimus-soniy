  'forewordBody': 'This little book and its author have been blessed with a truly fortunate destiny. Ahmad Hodiy Maqsudiy, born on September 26, 1868, in the village of Toshsuv in the Kazan district, and educated at the "Qosimiya" madrasa in Kazan — may Allah have mercy on him — composed this manual at a young age, praying to the Almighty that from generation to generation, the teaching of literacy based on the Arabic alphabet through the Word of Allah would continue, accompanied by introductory Quranic lessons. Although numerous interesting and substantial textbooks and manuals have since been created in this field, this modest little book, like the author\'s other works such as "Ibodati Islomiya," continues to attract students of knowledge in many Muslim lands thanks to its simplicity, accessibility, and closeness to the heart — and this is undoubtedly an answer to that prayer. Based on documents preserved in the manuscript collection of the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Uzbekistan and other sources, the following history of the book\'s distribution in Central Asia can be surmised. In 1902, Saidrasul Saidazizov\'s (1866–1933) manual "Ustodi Avval" ("The First Teacher") was published in Tashkent — the first textbook in Central Asia compiled using the phonetic method (usuli savtiya), which was used not only in Russian-native schools before the October Revolution but also in new-method schools as the primary literacy textbook in the Uzbek language. At that time in Russia, Ahmad Hodiy Maqsudiy\'s Russian-Tatar manual "Muallimi Avval" had gained wide renown. The title page of the copy that served as the basis for all subsequent Uzbek editions contains official documentation confirming this. After this alphabet primer was officially approved for classroom use in Tatar and Russian-Tatar schools in 1913, it was further noted: "Fourteenth edition. First edition approved by the Petrograd censorship on January 28, 1892. \'Umid\' Partnership Printing House. Kazan, 1917." From this it follows that after the first edition was approved, the book had for over twenty years informally earned its reputation in the field of public education before the state was compelled to grant it the status of an official textbook. From that point on, the book continued to serve in the Russian Empire and subsequently in the Muslim regions of the former Soviet Union until the successive introduction of the Latin and then the Cyrillic alphabets. The fact that the book was reprinted fourteen times before 1917, and dozens more times in subsequent periods, is vivid proof of this. Notably, in 1913 a book called "Muallimi Soniy" appeared in Tashkent bearing only the name of the publisher Ali Asgar (Kalinin), matching in content the very manual we are discussing. Naturally, subsequent editions were published under the author\'s name. Since then, it has served not only in our land but in many other countries, selflessly teaching literacy to generations. Taking all this into consideration, it was decided to present the manual to readers in its original form, merely clarifying the text that had become blurred from repeated copying and correcting minor technical errors. Of course, with the widespread adoption of Medina-style printing, there had initially been plans to adapt this book accordingly. However, preserving the book in its original form — a book that had become dear to peoples over many years and served them faithfully — seemed a sign of respect and gratitude to the memory of our ancestors who laid the foundations of enlightenment through it. Therefore, guided by the desire to preserve the authentic spirit of the manual, virtually no changes were made to the book. Only the script of the surahs was changed to the Medina typeface, given its widespread adoption in our region for easier reading, while the vowel marks were kept in their Kazan-style form. Furthermore, with the primary goal being not merely to teach reading of Arabic script, but from the very beginning to teach the correct pronunciation of each letter from its proper point of articulation for beautiful recitation of Quranic surahs, a recorded audio disc has been appended to the book. While studying the lessons, the student should listen carefully to the recordings, paying attention to the quality of letter pronunciation as well as the correct execution of the vowel marks — fatha, kasra, and damma. This is because the majority of errors in Quran recitation occur when letters are pronounced from incorrect articulation points: the sound "zod" is pronounced like "30," "sod" like "sin" or "tha"; the voiced "ba" is devoiced to "pa"; the consonants "mim," "nun," and "lam" in sukun position produce an unintended vibration (qalqala); and vowel marks are pronounced with ikhtilas, where 2/3 of the vowel is lost and only 1/3 is manifested. If attention is given to all these aspects, this manual with its supplement will serve as yet another important tool for learning the correct recitation of the Holy Quran — such is our hope. Although observing the rules of tajwid is not obligatory when pronouncing words other than those of the Holy Quran, since the goal is to accustom readers to correct Quranic recitation, the declarations of faith (iman) have also been read according to the rules of tajwid.',
